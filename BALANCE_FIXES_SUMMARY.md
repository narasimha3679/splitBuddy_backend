# Balance Calculation Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Incomplete Balance Calculation in User Balance Summary**

**Problem**: The original `calculateUserBalanceSummary` method was only considering scenarios where the user paid for expenses, but not properly calculating when others paid and the user participated.

**Fix**: 
- Now properly finds the user's participation in each expense
- When user paid: calculates total amount others owe to the user
- When others paid: calculates amount user owes to the payer
- Handles all scenarios where user is involved in expenses

### 2. **Incorrect Friend Balance Calculation**

**Problem**: The `calculateFriendBalances` method had flawed logic and was showing placeholder friend names.

**Fix**:
- Fixed balance calculation logic to properly track individual friend balances
- Added proper friend name retrieval from user repository
- Corrected the calculation to use user's actual participation amount

### 3. **Missing Documentation and Examples**

**Problem**: The balance calculation logic wasn't clearly documented with examples.

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive documentation explaining balance calculation logic
- Added example responses showing positive/negative balance meanings
- Added comments in code explaining the logic

## Balance Calculation Logic

### User Balance Summary
```
totalOwed = Sum of amounts others owe to user (when user paid for expenses)
totalOwes = Sum of amounts user owes to others (when others paid for expenses)
netBalance = totalOwed - totalOwes
```

### Individual Friend Balances
```
Positive balance = Friend owes money to user
Negative balance = User owes money to friend
Zero balance = No outstanding balance
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User paid for dinner
- User paid $100 for dinner
- User's share: $25
- Friend's share: $75
- **Result**: Friend owes user $75

### Scenario 2: Friend paid for lunch
- Friend paid $60 for lunch
- User's share: $30
- Friend's share: $30
- **Result**: User owes friend $30

### Scenario 3: Multiple expenses
- User paid $100 (friend owes $75)
- Friend paid $60 (user owes $30)
- **Net Result**: Friend owes user $45

## Endpoints Updated

1. `GET /api/expenses/balance/summary` - Now shows complete balance summary
2. `GET /api/expenses/user/{userId}/balance/summary` - Now shows complete balance summary
3. `GET /api/expenses/user/{userId}/balances` - Now shows proper friend names and balances

## Testing

Use the test endpoints in `expense-balance-test.http` to verify the fixes:

```bash
# Test user balance summary
GET http://localhost:8080/api/expenses/balance/summary

# Test friend balances
GET http://localhost:8080/api/expenses/user/1/balances

# Test specific friend expenses
GET http://localhost:8080/api/expenses/friend/2/expenses
```

The balance calculations now properly consider all scenarios where a user is involved in expenses, providing accurate financial summaries for both overall balance and individual friend balances.
